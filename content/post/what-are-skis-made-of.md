It's skiing season and I'm very excited about it except... I can't ski because I busted my knees. However I am still very curious to know what makes 
what skis are made of, and what is the difference between a beginner ski and a pro ski, like we can expect to see at the olympics in Febuary this year.

So, without getting in detail about the history of skis (which you can find in [this blog post](https://sciathlon.github.io/post/the-history-of-skiing/) ),
they used to be made entirely of wood. But actually, although we cannot see it, the core of the skis are still most of the time made of wood. 

To be continued^^
