      <description>Introduction The OBITools are a set of tools meant to format, edit, filter and analyze environmental DNA (eDNA) next generation sequencing (NGS) data in the command line using bash. They were developed at the Laboratoire d&amp;rsquo;Ecologie ALpine (LECA), in Grenoble, France. There are many other pipelines for metabarcoding data analysis, but if you choose these, so as long as you can format your files for the OBITools (a sometimes non-trivial task, I know&amp;hellip;), they are fairly easy to get a handle on.</description>

      <title>Anaconda packages and environments for bioinformatics: a tutorial</title>

      <description>After abandoning this blog for several years I am back with different content. I want to write tutorials on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned doing bioinformatics since I started my PhD, among other things and might be interesting or helpful to others. I started using anaconda during my postdoc in genomics and I use it every single day.
Today, I wanted to write a summary of things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned using anaconda packages and environments for bioinformatics (but the same commands will work for other types of packages as well).</description>

      <description>Today we will be looking at data about a health issue that affects many athletes: athlete&amp;rsquo;s foot. It&amp;rsquo;s not a very glamorous subject but it&amp;rsquo;s still interesting, as fungi are warrior eukaryotes that survive everywhere. Athlete&amp;rsquo;s foot is generally a fungal infection on the feet referred to as &amp;ldquo;tinea pedis&amp;rdquo; but can be something else that causes inflammation on the foot, however the definitions vary according to who you talk to&amp;hellip; I am going to stick to the more accepted definition which is the fungal infection.</description>

      <description>I am tackling a new topic today, which is waste generated during races. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you why this is coming up now. I started the racing season with a road 10km called Asparun which was a relatively small race, 354 runners on the 10k plus probably as many on the 5k, which is more people than I usually see at my small local races, and I saw so many people just throwing their water goblets not IN the trash but sometimes 500 meters away, and it shocked me.</description>

      <description>I am continuing my journey to learn awk and I finally managed to process (almost) an entire file today so let&amp;rsquo;s analyse the 2018 Tencin trail race. It was my first trail race of the season, and it kicks off the &amp;ldquo;challenge intercommunal du grésivaudan&amp;rdquo;, which is a set of 11 races in this region called the Grésivaudan which is a valley in between the two mountains of Belledonne and Chartreuse in the Alps.</description>

      <description>A me-centered data analysis today where I will share my experience running my first half marathon and the race data.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only been running regularly for a year, and I&amp;rsquo;d been dreaming about this day since I started. It was still kind of a dream for the longest time, something that I wanted but was still only a concept until the day arrived and I realized: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m running a half marathon today.</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;m at a metabarcoding school in Norway, so it gets dark very early and I have time for another post. In honor of the 2018 Winter Olympics finally kicking off, I asked a friend of mine who loves sports what data he would be interested in seeing in the sports that are in the winter Olympics and he answered &amp;ldquo;biathlon.&amp;rdquo; I found a website that collects lots of data on the sport called biathlonresults.</description>

      <description>Today I am using the RISmed package for R to analyze publications about triathlon. It is an amazing package to look through the Pubmed database for what they have on a certain subject. Pubmed is a NIH (USA) funded database which hosts articles about medicine and biology. Today, I am looking at studies that have been done on injuries, disease and human physiology that have to do with triathlon. I am not a triathlete yet, I am just focusing on running this year but it is on my radar.</description>

      <description>Today I am writing another piece about figure skating, also another piece about data analysis in this event. But I am not focusing solely on the Olympics this time but on the best scoring athletes and the best scoring event of each athlete. There is a lot of data to go through, so let&amp;rsquo;s get right into it! The data comes from the (International skating Union) website which I downloaded on the 20/01/2018 (if you try my code and the results are different it might be because the data on the website has changed).</description>

      <description>Analysing medals won per athlete/per country with R As I am learning data science by doing little projects, today I am introducing a little data analysis using R on figure skating in the Olympics. I am going to look at the medals won using data from the official Olympics database website. First I formatted the data to make it a csv (comma separated values) file which is very easy to parse in R</description>

      <description>The winter olympics are coming! This is not a data science article, but those will come soon. Anyway, tt is an exciting time to celebrate our favorite sports and feel inspired to do better ourselves. It is going to be interesting this year with the doping ban for Russia as well as many unfortunate injuries and retirements. Figure skating is my favorite event because it is an incredibly beautiful and hard sport that I practised for a few years when I was young.</description>

      <description>This article is not about data science but history, and one that came out of sheer curiosity that I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share. I started skiing at the age of 3 at the station in the Alps called the &amp;ldquo;Sept Laux&amp;rdquo; next to Grenoble, France. It was natural to me, but until now I never wondered for how long people have done it. Here is a brief history of how it all began.</description>

      <description>Today there isn&amp;rsquo;t any data science, I just wanted to share a list of my favorite sports-related YouTube channels, in no particular order.
TheGingerRunner If you are interested in running and want to learn more about trails, races, athletes, training, gear, nutrition, there are amazing ressources out therethat will teach and inspire you. I have compiled a little list of my favorite youtube channels that I have been following for years.</description>

      <description>Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?</description>

Here is some bold text
Here is a secondary heading Here&amp;rsquo;s a useless table:

      <description>To be, or not to be&amp;ndash;that is the question: Whether &amp;rsquo;tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep&amp;ndash; No more&amp;ndash;and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to. &amp;lsquo;Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep&amp;ndash; To sleep&amp;ndash;perchance to dream: ay, there&amp;rsquo;s the rub, For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.</description>

      <description>What is it with that Mary girl? Dragging me to school every day. As if I had a choice. What you don&amp;rsquo;t hear in those nursery rhymes is that she starves me if I don&amp;rsquo;t go to school with her; it&amp;rsquo;s the only way I can stay alive! I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about being adopted by Little Bo Peep, sure I may get lost, but anything is better than being with Mary and those little brats at school (shudder, shudder).</description>

      <description>Piracy is typically an act of robbery or criminal violence at sea. The term can include acts committed on land, in the air, or in other major bodies of water or on a shore. It does not normally include crimes committed against persons traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator (e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel). The term has been used throughout history to refer to raids across land borders by non-state agents.</description>
