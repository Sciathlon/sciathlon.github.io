      <description>I am tackling a new topic today, which is waste generated during races. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you why this is coming up now. I started the racing season with a road 10km called Asparun which was a relatively small race, 354 runners on the 10k plus probably as many on the 5k, which is more people than I usually see at my small local races, and I saw so many people just throwing their water goblets not IN the trash but sometimes 500 meters away, and it shocked me.</description>

      <description>A me-centered data analysis today where I will share my experience running my first half marathon and the race data.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only been running regularly for a year, and I&amp;rsquo;d been dreaming about this day since I started. It was still kind of a dream for the longest time, something that I wanted but was still only a concept until the day arrived and I realized: &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m running a half marathon today.</description>
